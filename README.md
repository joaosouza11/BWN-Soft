This site was created for training, using a fictitious company as a model.

It was used mostly HTML5 and CSS3 and contains some PHP for the contact form.

Part of the project structure was inspired by videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyTutorialsVideo" target="_blank">"Easy Tutorials"</a> channel and knowledge that I acquired through the courses of the <a href="cursoemvideo.com" target="_blank">"Curso em VÃ­deo"</a>.
